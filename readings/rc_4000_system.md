## RC 4000 System

This system was influential in inventing the concept of a "kernel", a base upon which the rest of the operating system can be built.

All operating systems up to then were designed for a specific mode of operation. The idea behind the nucleus concept was to make the operating mode independent from the operating system. 

The nucleus coordinates communication between *internal* and *external* processes using *message buffers* and *message queues*.
