We are using a Lenovo Thinkpad X220 running the Ubuntu 12.04 operating system with the 3.5.0-54 kernel. The specs of the machine are described below. Some of the following information could be directly found through the system by reading /proc/cpuinfo. Some of this information could only be derived from online documentation. In all cases, the origin of the derivation of the characteristics is shown.

\subsection{Processor}
The machine possesses a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2520M processor with 2 cores. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Each core has a clock frequency of 2.45 GHz}
    \item{The core has a separate data and instruction L1 cache. Each cache is 2 x 32 KB.}
\item{The L2 cache size is 2 x 256 KB.}
\item{The L3 cache size is 3 MB.}
\item{The processor uses a 64 bit instruction set.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Buses}

The machine uses the Intel terminology for buses. Data transfer between the CPU to the memory is done through a 5 GT/s front side bus (FSB). The machine uses PCI Express 2.0 buses for I/O purposes.

\subsection{Memory}

The machine possesses two DDR3 4GB memory banks. Both banks use the memory bus mentioned earlier (FSB). The memory banks support but do not use error correcting codes (ECC). 

\subsection{Storage}

The machine uses a 256 GB Samsung 830 Solid State Drive. The max sequential
reads occur at 520 MB/s and the max sequential writes occur at 400 MB/s. The max random read speed is 75K IOPS and max random write speed 30K IOPS.
