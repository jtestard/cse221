In order to run the different experiments in this section, simply run the profile.sh file.

Note that experiment 3 requires extra setup with the user of the cgroups linux techonology.
The experiment 3 will not work properly on a non-Linux machine.

Finally, note because the previous measurements were lost, the data shown in the pretty
measurement folder does not correspond exactly to that shown on the project report (it 
was obtained at a later date).
