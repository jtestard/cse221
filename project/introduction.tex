The goal of this project is to determine the performance characteristics of Richard's machine when running Ubuntu. We have made our experiments using C and assembly instructions without the help of external tools. The C compiler we have used is the gcc compiler (version 4.8.2). Optimization settings we have used for our compiler settings have varied across our measurements (more details in the paper).
